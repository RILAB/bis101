## Quiz1

Sex-linked traits can be passed to offspring by which parent, mom or dad?  

Sex-linked traits can be passed to offspring by both mom and dad, but only by dad is the trait is Y-linked. Both males and females get sex-linked genes because they both need to inherit sex chromosomes (humans: X & Y). 

## Quiz 2

Sensory ataxic neuropathy (SAN) is a mitochondrially inherited disorder found in golden retrievers, where affected dogs lack muscle coordination. If a male dog with SAN is crossed with a female dog without SAN, what is the probability that the puppies have SAN?
The probability is 0, as mitochondria are maternally inherited. The mother does not have SAN. (also accept answers talking about exceedingly rare heteroplasmy)
## Quiz3

You begin inbreeding white rabbits in your backyard, and determine white coat color is autosomal recessive to colored coats. Your friend, a magician who bought one of your inbred white rabbits, tells you that he has a cool trick. He crossed one of your white rabbits to a white rabbit purchased from a commercial rabbit breeder (where the white phenotype is also autosomal recessive). All F1 rabbits were brown. Do you think this result is magic? What is the genetic basis of this result?
Not magic, just complementation. The gene you have made homozygous prevents pigment formation (let's call it bb, B>b), but a different gene in the pigment formation pathway is nonfunctional in the commercial rabbit line (and letâ€™s call that gene cc, C>c). This means the genotypes of the parents are bbCC and BBcc, and the F1 are all BbCc, and brown.

## Quiz 4

Do you think exome sequencing will still be used in 10 years? If not, what other method(s) will be used and why?

Targeted re-sequencing and exome sequencing in 2010 was more economical than whole genome sequencing. Today, DNA sequencing is much cheaper (in terms of MB) and will likely be standard practice (vs. exome sequencing) in 10 years.
	
## Quiz 5

DHODH is a gene in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, and prior to this study, an unlikely candidate gene for causing Miller syndrome. Would the approach of this paper have worked in identifying the molecular basis of Miller syndrome if DHODH caused Miller syndrome in family 1, but a different gene in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway caused Miller syndrome in families 2 and 3? Why or why not?
No, because they assumed Miller syndrome was monogenic. Their filtering strategy looked for one gene with alleles containing rare variants across all three families.The authors discuss ways to relax this monogenic assumption (i.e., allow for genetic heterogenity), given enough affected individuals and pedigrees, and prove this in a later paper discussing the molecular basis of Kabuki syndrome (Ng et. al., 2010, Exome sequencing identifies MLL2 mutations as a cause of Kabuki syndrome)
