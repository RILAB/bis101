# Go over HWE again.  

* Obs. Counts  
* Obs. Genotype freq.  
* Obs. Allele freq.  
* Expected genotype freq.  
* Expected genotype counts  
* Chi-squared

You observe the following genotypes in a natural population: AA 5; Aa 38; aa 82. What is the allele frequency of A?
  
	p=0.192

What are the expected counts of the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes? (use p=0.2 if you couldn't answer part 1)
	
	f_AA = 0.0368, but in population of 125, so expect 4.6
	f_Aa = 0.3103, but in population of 125, so expect 38.8
	f_aa = 0.6529, but in population of 125, so expect 81.6

Is this population in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium? Hint: chi-square > 3.84 is significant.

	Yes. 
	chisquare=((5-4.6)^2)/4.6 + ((38-38.8)^2/38.8) + ((82-81.6)^2/81.6)
	chisquare=0.053
	0.053 < 3.84
  
# Conclusions

Single generation of random mating will almost always -> HWE

Rare alleles more common in hets (p^2 < 2pq for whenever p < q)

Does dominance change HWE?
- no because we haven't said anything about phenotype -- just genotype
- so will recessive alleles go extinct <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
            
Surprising # of loci in diff. organisms cannot reject HWE 
- does this mean no selection, drift, mutation <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  why not?

# Q1
# Q2

### Violate an assumption

Can show effects of violating an assumption (nonequal # of sexes etc.)

Some assumptions have sm. FX 

- nonequal sexes, takes longer than 1 gen of random mating to reach HWE but still reach it 
- drift or selection -> never reach
- nonrandom mating: include parameter F and can rewrite HWE with inbreeding coefficient

## DRIFT

in HWE with $N==\infty$ inf what happens to allele freqs over time (nothing)

in small pops, random chance is imp. (think about freq. heads depends on sample size)

Draw on board 6 individuals  (1 AA 3 Aa 2 aa ) (can do X^2 and show sample does not reject HWE)

- If this is whole pop.: (calculate freqs.) use die roller app to pick mates for next gen.
- Recalculate freqs. (has evolution happened?)
- do a couple more (maybe until fixation?)

Smaller N -> more drift; Bigger N -> less drift (but still nonzero)

Other things associated with drift (define):

- bottleneck
- founder effect

Other deviations from HWE cause drift -- separate sexes, etc, uneven offspring production.  Humans have as much drift as a theoretical pop of size 10K in spite of being 7Billion of us!

Effective pop size: size of a theoretical population meeting all assumptions that has same model allele freq. behavior as your pop.

- because most pops violate assumptions, Ne almost always << N
- Ne is what matters for drift. 
   - Big census size w/ lots of size fluctuation similar drift to smaller pop w/ constant size
- e.g. Ne for Humans is 10K
- for dairy cows 100
- for drosophila 2M

Will skip the math, but:

Drift causes inbreeding: random mating in pop of sample 10, soon you're mating w/ relatives by random!

Chance of fixation due to drift = frequency. So most new mutations (at freq. $\frac{1}{2N}$) are lost by to drift!

Differences between species: $2N\mu$ mutations per gen. * $\frac{1}{2N}$ chance of fixing = $\mu$ differences between species per gen. (or between genes, i.e. Ks)

## Selection

Natural Selection not same as evolution 

- change in frequency of a variant due to its effect on fitness
- multiple components to fitness: viability, mating success, fecundity
- Think in terms of relative fitness: some most fit genotype, and all other genotypes are competing with it
- variant that makes you compete better and make more copies of your genes -> natural selection will increase freq.

Fitness Table for locus that affects fitness

Genotype | $A_1A_1$ | $A_1A_2$ | $A_2A_2$
--- | --- | --- | ---
Freq. | $p^2$ | $2p(1-p)$ | $(1-p)^2$
Fitness | $w_{11}$ | $w_{12}$ | $w_{22}$
 
relative fitness of $A_1A_1$ is $w_{11}$  

- not faster than the bear, faster than the other guy

mean fitness of populaton is avg. weighted by frequency

\bar{w} = $p^2w_{11}+2p(1-p)w_{12}+w_{22}(1-p)^2$
      
genotype freq. change depends on rel. fitness, so

- $X'=\frac{p^2w_{11}}{\bar{w}}$
- $Y'=\frac{2p(1-p)w_{12}}{\bar{w}}$
- $Z'=\frac{(1-p)^2w_{22}}{\bar{w}}$

can do some math and show allele freq:

- $p'= \frac{p(p^2 w_{11}+p(1-p)w_{12})}{\bar{w}}$
       
### results: 

- change in allele freq. depends on difference in fitness b/t heterozygote and homozygote for the allele
- allele freq. (greater change with more middling allele freq)
- stronger s -> faster change in p,
- this general formula allows variation. 
	- e.g. w11=1 w12=1-s w22=1-2s -- when het is intermediate additive or incomplete dominance  
	- w11=1 w12=1 w22=1-s (dominance of $A_1$)  
	- w11=1 w12=1-s w22=1-s (recessive $A_1$)  
  - what would this be for neutral locus?  
- draw graph for recessive, dominant, codominant

Ask to interpret graph *???*

## Q3

## Other forces

Gene flow: movement of genes from one population to another

- can impact allele frequencies and counteract selection and drift
- different pops should drift independently, but even one migrant/generation enough to prevent extensive divergence

Mutation

- fairly straightforward, increases freq of particular allele

## Combos

Mutation-selection balance:

- assuming selection against recessive: $p=(\frac{\mu}{s})^0.5$
- for a completely recessive mutation, even under lethal selection (s=1) the freq. of A will be $\mu^0.5$
