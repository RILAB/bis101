## Q1 

3' TACGATCT 5'   
5' ATGCTAGA 3'(Draw on board within a replication fork on the right side)
If the replication fork is moving to the right, which strand is the template for the leading strand? Write the sequence of the leading strand, labeling the 5' and 3' ends.

	Top strand (3'-->5') will be the template, and the leading strand will be 5' ATGCTAGA 3'.
	
## Q2

What is meant by 'primer' in the context of DNA replication? Draw an example of a primer on the following (single stranded) DNA molecule, and label its 5' and 3' ends, indicating the direction that replication will proceed.

5' ------------------- 3'

	A primer is a short nucleotide sequence (in context of replication, a RNA molecule produced by primase), that provides a 3'OH for extension to occur by polIII.
	Primer:        <-3'--5'
	5' ------------------- 3'


## Q3

Why is gene expression regulated?

	Save resources, development, respond to environment.


## Q4 

Why can RNA be translated at the same time as it is transcribed in prokaryotes, but not in eukaryotes?

	The eukaryotic nucleus separates transcription from translation, as transcription occurs in the nucleus (where the DNA is), and translation in the cytoplasm (where the ribosomes are).

## Q5 

How do the authors measure gene expression levels of GFP?

	GFP glows. They can measure flourescence
