Paper doesn't have standard format, intro/methods etc. so a bit harder to read.

## Recombination

Recombination is a phenotype. (Is rec a phenotype<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>)

Recombination is heritable. 

Hotspots are regions of clustered localized recombination.  Most CO are in hotspots.

## Previous studies

LD-based hotspots across the human genome and usage

   - how does LD tell you about hotspots<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

Hotspot usage is a heritable phenotype h^2 = 0.22

CO in Hutterite families based on pedigree

Recombination activity in mice tied to genetic locus (QTL mapping!)

Hotspots in humans enriched for a 13bp motif (whoa!) that acts in cis (what is cis<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>)


## What they did

Do more mouse crosses, refine QTL to narrower region. Why does more crossing help <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (Draw?)

* candidate gene PRDM9 in mice is
	1. ZFN
	2. expressed in meiotic prophase
	3. encodes for histone methyltransferase (different histone methlyation levels observed in these mice in hotspots)

* ZFN prediction hard and imperfect, so look at ortholog in humans. 

PRDM9 in humans predicts the 13bp motif!

Genotypes of Europeans at PRDM9 for some common European population resources (CEPH etc.)

* Common allele A 0.9, B 0.5, but lots of other alleles (so can be AI BC AK etc.)
* In Hutterites, A 0.94, B 0.4, i, 0.2

* Correlated genotype with hotspot usage. They found <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

	- AI significantly less usage of hotspots than AA
	- even more than predicted based on occurence of motif, suggesting I dominant?
	- allele I must recognize different motif
	- AI individuals use hotspots differently, but NOT less recombination!
	
Showed molecular interaction between different PRDM9 alleles and DNA motifs

* SW blot (protein gel, blotted with DNA)
* band-shift assay: more DNA, bigger complex, moves less far. (quantitative)
	
## Conclusions

Hotspot usage explained by PRDM9 alleles -- one gene!

Most recombintion in hotspots

Can change genetic maps by changing variation at this locus

Explains hotspot paradox

Necessary for meiosis and correlated with sterility in species hybrids

Shown under positive selection in mammals -- but only those parts of the gene that change recognition!
