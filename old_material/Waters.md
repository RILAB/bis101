## Intro

Imprinting.  What is imprinting <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>



Draw box gene and cross between mom and dad. How can I tell which allele is expressed <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Need SNPs.

Now that I can show gene is expressed comes from mom, is this imprinting <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> No, could be **allele-specific expression**

Why can't I just measure expression in parents? Why in F1 <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

* First, just shows total expression level, not imprinting.
* Second, genes are affected by *cis* and *trans*. Putting in same individual evens out the trans, so we can see effects of *cis*.  

Would imprinting (epigenetic silencing be cis or trans<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> cis.

What's one theory for why imprinting occurs<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

* maternal tissue is demethylated. 
* TEs that are silenced are activated.  
* this generates siRNA. siena can move among cells, and silence TEs in other cells.
* why in central cell and not egg cell<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (TEs do bad things when activated! not want in your gamete!)

Another <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
* kinship theory. MEGs don't want to give too much to offspring
* PEGs do. not related to mom, so who cares.

## Methods

Sequence RNA from endosperm tissue of 5 reciprocal hybrid pairs.  A x B and B x A to distinguish imprinting from alelel-specific

stats. why have different cutoff for mom vs. dad<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> b/c two copies of mom, so expect 2:1

validation with individual SNP assays.

orthology with maize and rice and sorghum
* compare dn/ds of imprinted and not. why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

evidence of selection using data from previous whole-genome sequencing. selection on endosperm during domestication, so maybe imprinted genes should be selected!

## Results

RNAseq data. Stuff showing higher from one parent regardless of origin is what <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> cis variation

Why need higher read abundance to determine if maternally imprinted <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Because mom has 2 alleles and dad 1 in endosperm

Explain Fig. 1

Some imprinted expression not in endosperm. More MEGs preferentially in endosperm.

Most PEGs were targets of histone methylation. What does this suggest<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Being shut down!

More PEGs that are conserved. How tell <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> syntenic Ortholog in rice or thaliana.  But overall few conserved.

Fig. 2 explanation (allelic variation, failure of Oh43 to be silenced)

At least 12% of the loci showing imprinting showed allelic variation. Perhaps suggesting random (TE) variation rather than something adaptive.

Identified some genes that show conservation of imprinting to rice and even thaliana.  Interpretation <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Imprinting of these genes likely pretty important!

MEGs have more recent duplicates. Of retained duplicates following fractionation, some have lost imprinting (maybe subfucntionalization <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> ), but some maintain it.

Imprinted genes not under selection though domestication selected on maize kernels.

Explain figure 3.

Imprinted genes that are conserved showed higher dn/ds -- interpretation <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> either weaker selection against nonsyn or more likely (?) positive selection over time.

## Discussion

MEGS and PEGS are different !!

Allelic variation supports TE idea.

Conserved imprinting not super common, but those genes probably do cool stuff.

Evidence of positive selection, but not strong. So no super support for genomic conflict idea.
