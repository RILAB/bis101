## Intro

Imprinting.  What is imprinting <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>



Draw box gene and cross between mom and dad. How can I tell which allele is expressed <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Need SNPs.

Now that I can show gene is expressed comes from mom, is this imprinting <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> No, could be **allele-specific expression**

Why can't I just measure expression in parents? Why in F1 <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

* First, just shows total expression level, not imprinting.
* Second, genes are affected by *cis* and *trans*. Putting in same individual evens out the trans, so we can see effects of *cis*.  

Would imprinting (epigenetic silencing be cis or trans<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> cis.

What's one theory for why imprinting occurs<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

* maternal tissue is demethylated. 
* TEs that are silenced are activated.  
* this generates siRNA. siena can move among cells, and silence TEs in other cells.
* why in central cell and not egg cell<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (TEs do bad things when activated! not want in your gamete!)

Another <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
* kinship theory. MEGs don't want to give too much to offspring
* PEGs do. not related to mom, so who cares.

## Methods

Sequence RNA from endosperm tissue of 5 reciprocal hybrid pairs.  A x B and B x A to distinguish imprinting from alelel-specific

stats. why have different cutoff for mom vs. dad<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> b/c two copies of mom, so expect 2:1

validation with individual SNP assays.

orthology with maize and rice and sorghum
* compare dn/ds of imprinted and not. why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>


evidence of selection using data from previous whole-genome sequencing. selection on endosperm during domestication, so maybe imprinted genes should be selected!
