## Q1 **Mutation**

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs when there are more than 36 CAG repeats in frame in the HTT gene, leading to too many glutamine amino acids. You are analyzing a trio (parents and their son). Both parents are in their 80's and do not have Huntington's disease, but the son begins to show symptoms of Huntington's disease in his late 40's. How is this possible, given the pattern of inheritance? How many CAG repeats do you think the parents have? How many CAG repeats does the child have?

	De novo mutation via replication slippage in germline of either parent, leading to expansion of repeat in child. Parents < 36; Child >36.

## Q2 **Mutation**

Ancon sheep are a breed of sheep with short legs, selectively bred because they couldn't jump over stone fences and escape from farmers in the 19th century. Unfortunately, Ancon sheep are now extinct. The phenotype is similar to short-legged dogs like dachshunds and basset hounds, which have a deletion in the FGF4 gene (fibroblast growth factor). If you had access to ancient Ancon DNA, and wanted to identify whether Ancon sheep had a deletion in FGF4 relative to wild type sheep, how could you test this without sequencing? (aka, you only have access to PCR and gel electrophoresis)

	Primers upstream of FGF4, downstream of FGF4, and do PCR. WT sheep should have longer band than Ancon with the deletion.

## Cvalue

Genlisea aurea has a genome size of 52Mb.  Another species in the genus has a genome size of 1,700Mb. How many more or fewer genes will this large genome species likely have and why? 

	none. c-value not correlate with complexity. genome size due to TEs.
	
## Q4 TEs

You've isolated a corn plant with colorless kernels, sequenced the c gene, and determined that an autonomous retrotransposon is inserted into the coding sequence of the gene (rather than a DNA transposon like in the previous example). You self this plant, hoping to make spotted kernels. All the kernels of this cross are colorless. You probe the cells with antibodies to reverse transcriptase and integrase, and confirm that all the enzymes required for transposition are present. Why didn't you get spotted kernels?

	Retrotransposons 'copy and paste,' so are not removed from a locus. Transposition may be occurring, but new integrations are at different chromosomal positions.

## Q5 Tes

Nectarines are closely related to peaches, but don't have fuzzy hairs on their skin. This is due to a transposable element insertion into a gene, PpeMYB25, which is known to be upregulated in cells that make trichomes (plant hairs). We saw that the Hopscotch insertion in an enhancer increased expression of tb1 in maize; what do you think the expression levels of PpeMYB25 are in nectarine? What part of the gene do you think the TE insertion occurred in?

	The TE insertion makes it so nectarines don't have hairs, suggesting PpeMYB25 isn't expressed. This is most likely because of an insertion in an exon, leading to a premature stop codon, but could also be from an insertion in a promoter (which disrupts polII binding, so no transcription) or a splice site which changes splicing.
