#Q1

A c/C-DS chromosome, when with an Ac, can mutate and make yellow kernels with purple patches.  If I had a C/c genotype with a Ds near the C, and Ac activated it, what would the phenotype be?

	purple kernel yellow splotches

#Q2 P element selection experiment

What is the effect on Va of P element movement?


	P element insertion will increase additive genetic variance

#Q3 **Inversions**

--[TE]-X-[Aexon1]--[Aexon2]--------------------[Bexon2]---[Bexon1]--X--

Spreading of methylation of the transposable element reduces expression of gene A, because its promoter becomes methylated, and various transcription factors can't bind. If an inversion occurred between the X's, what would you expect the impact (after several generations) to be on expression of gene A? Gene B?


	gene B will become silenced.  gene A may either remain silenced or, if methylation is lost, become expressed again.

#Q 4

 John's dad has Kleinfelters syndrome.  John comes to you as a genetic counselor after being gneotyped as a normal XY to ask what risk is.  What can you tell John about his sonâ€™s parentage?

	that is not his dad, because kleinfelters causes sterility
	
#Q5 Ibarra-Laclette

Based on the relatively consistent gene number found in plant genomes, does subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization occur to each pair of gene duplicates? Why or why not?

	no it does not -- could be deleted.  but give everyone a point here because my question was poorly worded
