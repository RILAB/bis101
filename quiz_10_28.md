Cookie mites live on the planet Nestle. Cookiemonster, the premier astronaut from Sesame Street, visits the planet. Only the fastest cookie mites are able to run away and survive, while slow cookies get eaten. The relative fitness of three genotypes for speed in Cookie mites are ωA/A = 1.0, ωA/a = 1.0, ωa/a = 0.7. If the population starts at the allele frequency p = 0.4, what is the value of p’?

	Use the following equations:


	p’ = 0.4[0.4(1.0) + 0.6(1.0)]/[(0.16)(1.0) + (0.48)(1.0) + (0.36)(0.7)] 
	    = 0.4/0.892
	    = 0.45
	   
## Q2 

Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation at the CFTR gene. Individuals homozygous for the mutation (prior to modern medical treatment) die before reproducing. Heterozygotes appear normal. An island was settled by 80 normal homozygotes and 20 heterozygote carriers. What are the allele frequencies of the normal and disease alleles, and the predicted genotype frequencies after one generation of random mating?

	p=0.9, 1-p=0.1
	AA=0.81, Aa=0.18, aa=0.01

## Q3

An extinct species of duck from Hawaii, the Kaua'i mole duck, was blind and flightless, lived in caves, and probably used its beak to rake through leaves to find invertebrates to eat. Since this duck is blind, you hypothesize that it has a large expansion of odorant receptor genes to use its sense of smell to explore its environment. You find a sample that is 6000 years old, extract DNA, and sequence its genome. You find 673 odorant receptors, as compared to 174 in a mallard duck. If you hypothesize that the mole duck odorant receptor gene family expanded through gene duplications, how many odorant receptors do you expect to find in a swan? (phylogeny is (((mallard,mole),swan),chicken)

	Mallards could have lost odorant receptors, in which case, swans would have ~673 ORs. But, you're told that these genes expanded along the mole duck lineage. So swans should have ~174 ORs. 
	
## Q4

Pigmentation is an important survival trait for brain slugs. On planet Voltron, there was a gene duplication in green brain slugs for pigment color. Over time, one of the duplicates became inactivated due to mutation. This pseudogene and the functional gene evolve overtime through two different processes. If I come back in 1000 years, what would dn/ds look like in the pseudogene?  In the functional copy?

	The pseudogene evolves via random genetic drift, and the functional gene copy evolves 	via natural selection.  So pseudogene dn/ds=1, functional dn/ds<<1  
	
	
## Q5

Why did the authors recover higher coverage (76.6x) of the mitochondrial genome than the nuclear genome (1x)? Or the Y-chromosome?

	In humans, there are many copies of mitochondria per cell, but only one nucleus per cell.
