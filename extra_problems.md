1. Farmer Jones is trying to eliminate a recessive dwarf allele at the dwarfus locus from his pea crop. In 2010, his fields yielded 9% dwarf plants. You may assume that his population in 2010 is in HWE. When planting his 2011 crop, the farmer used only the seeds from the tall plants of the previous year. Tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d). If there is no further selection, what do you predict will be the frequency of dwarf pea plants in the 2011 crop?
