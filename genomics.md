#Genomics

	what is "the genome"?

what's it good for:

- understand evolution 
	- clues to function (same gene in diff. organisms likely similar function)
- identify functional variants (mapping)
	- fine i can show segregation w/ markers, but genome -> variant!
    - much of reverse and forward genetics not possible w/o!
- understanding mechanism (methylation, TEs, transcription, etc.)

example of sexy dates:

- sequenced genome
- like some plants, has male and female individuals
- screen markers across known genome sequence

		what does the pedigree tell you about phenotype/genotype?
    
- looked for markers who tracked sex along pedigree
- identified sex chromosomes

##Genetic vs. Physical Maps

explain each

	how to connect (restriction enzymes, DNA seq. markers)

explain big physical, small genetics -> low recombination



## Genomes as refs. genomic annotation

	so how do i know where the genes are? how to annotate?

explain browser, RNA sequence, etc.

	why not all RNA line up with gene? splice site variation

show added features

show methlyation status, nucleosome occupancy (may vary)

##How to sequence a genome
shotgun

	why difficult to assemble repeats?
##Variation
	what's missing from reference genomes?

- centromeres
- heterochromatin
- telomeres
- duplicate genes/paralogs
there's a reference, but lots of variation

kinds of variants:

- SNPs
- indels (explain ancestral/derived unknown)
- CNVs / PAVs

human example w/ **SNPs**

maize example w/ missing sequence **CNV PAV indel**

##Functional Variation

amylose copy number in saliva correlates with starch in human diet. why?

- more copies of gene == more expression, better digestions

- SNP explains whether you like the taste of cilantro

but not all functional, most of the >3M SNPs in humans have no functional consequence!

## Gene duplication

important form of genomic change

**ortholog paralog**

## Sub vs. neo vs. pseudo

	what would happend to a pseudogene over time?
    
    

## Genomic Rearrangement -- large scale changes

talked about inversions, duplications, polyploidy, translocations
