# Quiz 11/25

#1 **Translation**

Which direction does the ribosome move on a Turkey mRNA molecule? 5'->3' or 3'>5'?

	The ribosome moves from the 5' end of the mRNA molecule, where the two subunits assemble at the start codon. The ribosome then progresses in the 3' direction, adding amino acids until a stop codon is reached. 
	
#2 **Protein Coding Sequences**

In turkeys, does the start codon code for an amino acid? Does the stop codon?

	The start codon codes for methionine, the stop codon doesn't code for an amino acid.


#3 **PCR**

You accidentally used DNA polymerase from a Turkey in your PCR reaction. Will your PCR reaction work? Why?

	Polymerase would denature, you'd only get a cycle of amplification. So, it would not amplify very many copies.

#4 PCR

I want to PCR amplify the 5'UTR of the gene that makes turkeys yummy. In order to design a primer for this region, what do I need to know?
	
	A primer is a short piece of DNA that provides a 3'OH that DNA polymerase can extend. You need to know the sequence of the gene in order to specifically target the gene with a primer that matches it.
	

#5 **Yin et al.**

Imagine I have a hyper-intelligent Turkey with a PhD in molecular Genetics. This Turkey reads yin et al. What would the Turkey's explanation be for why there are two bands in the mutant mice injected with FAH1, FAH2, or FAH3?

	The repaired band is longer, as exon 8 is included in the mature transcript. Not all cells are repaired, so there are still cells with the mutant copy present, making mRNA that lacks exon 8.
