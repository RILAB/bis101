**Lecture 4 review - maps**

What units is a genetic map measured in? What units is a physical map measured in?

	A genetic map is a measure of recombination events between genetic markers, and can be measured in cM or map units.
	A physical map is a measure of the number of base pairs between genetic markers, and can be measured in base pairs (bp), kilobases (kb), megabases (Mb), or gigabases (Gb).


**Lecture 4 review - crossover/probability**

Given this genetic map:  A----15cM----B---10cM---C, what is the expected frequency of double crossovers between genes A and C?

	You need a crossover event between A-B and B-C. The probability of observing a recombination event between A and B is 0.15, and the probability of observing a recombination event between B and C is 0.1. We're assuming recombinations are independent, so for both to happen, we need to multiply probabilities. 0.15 * 0.1 = 0.015

**Lecture 4 review, linkage**

If the genes for round/wrinkled peas and green/yellow pea plants were located on the same chromosome, 5 cM apart, would Mendel have been able to come up with both laws of inheritance?

	No, the genes are linked and would not assort independently. They would still follow the 1st law of segregation.

**Lecture 5, additive effects**

Assume that the difference between an inbred line of cucumbers yielding 6 cucumbers per plant (genotype aabbcc) and an inbred line yielding 12 cucumbers per plant (genotype AABBCC) is due to three unlinked genes of equivalent effect. Each uppercase allele allows production of two cucumbers, and each lowercase allele allows production of one cucumber. What will the genotype of the F1 plant be? How many cucumbers will the F1 plant produce?

	The F1 genotype is AaBbCc. This means that the F1 will produce 9 cucumbers (2*3 uppercase alleles + 1*3 lowercase alleles).

**Paper Question**

What do you think the yup locus does (see Fig 3A)? How does the cardinalis allele at this locus influence bee visitation? The lewisii allele?

	The yup locus controls how carotenoid (orange) pigments are distributed on the petals. The cardinalis allele is recessive, and allows carotenoids to spread across the entire petal, resulting in orange/red flowers. The dominant lewisii allele restricts carotenoid spreading, so results in pink flowers. Bees prefer pink flowers (LL or LC) to red flowers (CC), and visit them more often.
