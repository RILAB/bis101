At the end of the paper the authors discuss that the correlation between highly expressed genes and usage of common codons is not due to common codons CAUSING genes to be highly expressed.  What's their explanation?

	Highly expressed genes need to use common codons so that they don't cause problems for other genes.  If a hihgly expressed gene uses a rare codon other genes using that codon may have trouble getting translated, leading to slower bacterial growth and fitness consequences.

	
##2 Transcription
If you see the following mRNA transcript (5' ACTG 3'), which is the coding strand (top or bottom)? Why? 
(Draw following strand on board: 5' ATCAGTA 3'
					       3' TAGTCAT 5')
	
	The bottom strand is the coding strand, as it contains the same sequence as the RNA. 


##3 Splicing

A eukaryotic structural gene has two introns and three exons:
5’-exon1-intron1-exon2-intron2-exon3-3’

The GU at the 5’ end of intron2 has been mutated so it is no longer recognized. What
would the mature mRNA look like in the wild type and in the mutant?

	Wild type: 5’-exon1-exon2-exon3-3’
	Mutant: 5’-exon1-exon2-intron2-exon3-3’


## 4 Operons
Yersinia pestis (the bacteria that causes plague) has an operon which responds to iron. The Fur (Ferric uptake regulator) protein binds to iron in mammalian blood, and then this complex binds to an operator site on the DNA, inducing expression of downstream genes involved in iron assimilation. Is this an example of positive or negative regulatory control?

	This is a case of positive control, because when iron is present, these genes are activated. The state in the absence of iron is 'off,' and Fur does not bind to DNA.


##5 Operons**

In a partial diploid (O+ Z+ Y+ / O+ Z- Y+), is the Z+ allele dominant or recessive?

	The Z+ allele is dominant, as this heterozygote produces enough beta galactosidase when induced to cleave the lactose present in the cell. The heterozygote has the same phenotype as a Z+ haploid (and presumably Z+/Z+ partial diploid).
