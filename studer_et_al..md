tb1 is a QTL for tillering

represses lateral organ growth

## fine mapping

previous work mapped causative locus to region around tb1. but no coding differences between maize and teosinte . possible explanation <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

later work fine-mapped this to a region  ~60kb upstream of tb1 ORF. implying <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> enhancer

Made big mapping pop, isolated recombinants in this region: how <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Dense array of markers in region, look for CO

Found 18 COs in region, made each homozygous by selfing

Two different components to region that affect phenotype differently. multiple effects on phenotype (Pleiotropy).

### Popgen analysis

previous work had shown decreased diversity 5' UTR and up to 60kb away from tb1. NO coding differences in tb1!

lower diversity in maize than teo suggests <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> selection on maize

lower diversity in this region in teosinte vs. other regions suggests <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> functional constraint which means <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

(show figure)

HKA test: compare diversity to difference from outgroup. if low diversity due to mutation, should be fewer differences.  but if see large differences (implying high mutation) then low diversity is surprising

Tested frequency of these in maize and teosinte more broadly: what do you predict <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Should be nearly fixed.  That is what they found (>95% maize)

How old are these insertions?  Used data from the sequence of the TE to estimate age: 20K years.  So since maize was domesticated 10K years ago, what does this say<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Not a new mutation, but one that was already in teosinte!

### Functional assays

Evidence for selection combined w/ fine-mapping limits area for causative mutation

In this regions, only 4 differences between maize and teosinte.:

* 2 SNPs
* two TEs: a MITE (nonautonomous DNA transposon) & a larger Hopscotch (LTR retro)

Tested each in transient assay (enhancer trapping). (NOS terminator stops transcription)

Distal represses expression, but with or without MITE

Proximal enhances expression, but only with HOPSCOTCH
