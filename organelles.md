## Organelles
up until now focused on nuclear genome  

label mito and chloro 

eukaryotes defined by presence of nucleus and organelles

some euks (giardia & some amoeba) have subsequently lost mito

## Crosses and inheritance chloro
heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy  

by random dreplication/division (fig. 19.4) var. branch -> green or white  

var. branch flowers -> green/white/var. offspring  

## Inheritance in mammals
inheriteance of mito in mammals -- always maternal

so mitochondrial diseases (some deafness, muscle myopathy)

blindness pedigree: normal, incomplete penetrance

label 

- oocyte development- 
- mutant (blue mito)
- unaffected
- intermediate
- affected offspring

## Organellar - nuclear interaction
wild type plants produce two mito genes MG1 and MG2

multiple origins of novel ORF (what's an ORF?)

sterile pollen grains don't stain

sterility cosegregates w/ RFLP cutting extra ORF

## Gene transfer
label:

- mito
- chloro
- nucleus
- proteins
	- blue host  
	- red mito   
	- green chloro  
- cyanobacterium
- protein function: 
	- in chloro 
	- mito
	- other nonorganellar  
- dashed arrows: continued transfer  
    

## Mito genome
less restictive wobble rules

Mito code differs for some codons in some species

thus fewer tRNAs, also some coded for in nuclear genome  

label (**what do each do?**):  
- rrNA (red)   
- mRNA (blue)  
- tRNA (black lines) 

heavy strand (inside); literally has higher mass b/c mroe G's and A's  
- in humans mostly protein coding and tRNA

light strand (outside)  

3 promoters  
- HSP1, HSP2, LSP (promoters for heavy light strand)

trasncription happens from 3 promotoers

then cleaved to separate pieces



## Chloro genome
