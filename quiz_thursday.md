## Q1

Kennewick Man, a 7500 year old human skeleton was discovered in Washington state in 1996. Some archaeologists have been puzzled by his skull shape, which they say contains characters that resemble modern Polynesian skulls. If you were to sequence Kennewick Man, and had access to a modern Polynesian genome, a modern Native American genome, and a modern European genome, where would you draw a migration edge on the following tree, assuming the archaeologists were correct? Why would you draw it there?
(((Native American, Kennewick Man), Polynesian), European)

	Admixture (arrow) from Polynesian to Kennewick Man.

## Q2

rad993 is a protein in cookie mites that is involved in DNA damage repair in both mitosis and meiosis. In mole ducks, there are two duplicate homologs, rad993A and rad993B. rad993A is involved in damage repair only during mitosis and rad993B only during mitosis? What is the relationship (paralog, ortholog, nucleolog) between these genes?  By what process (psuedogenization, neofunctionalization, radicalization, subfunctionalization, defunctionalization) did these evolve?

	paralog. subfunctionalization.


##Q3 

From extensive backyard rabbit breeding, you are now well aware that there are at least two genes that control white fur color in rabbits, and that white fur is recessive to colored fur. You have a phylogeny of wild rabbit species, (((swamp rabbit, desert cottontail), volcano rabbit), Central African rabbit). If white rabbits are observed in natural populations of only desert cottontails and swamp rabbits, where on the tree do you think the white alleles of these genes arose? 

	Common ancestor of swamp/desert.
	Common ancestor of swamp/desert/volcano, since these are recessive.
	Also accept answers about white allele segregating earlier, if explain alleles are lost or at low frequency in volcano, central african lineages

## Q4 

You heard that tardigrades (known as water bears) can be heated for a few minutes to 151 degrees Celsius (that's 304 degrees F). You see that 35% of the bases in its genome are cytosine. What percentage of the bases are adenine? 

	G=C, A=T, and A+C+G+T = 1
	A=0.15



## Q5

Why do organisms with circular genomes not need telomerase?

	There's always a free 3' end in a circle.
