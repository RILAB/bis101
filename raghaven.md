## Intro

Native American Origins

We know came through Berring straight

Some genetic data makes them seem European. Could be <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

*  Could be recent admixture
*  Could be ancient admixture
*  Strange European origins

Sequenced a 24K individual from Siberia.

Lots of issues with ancient DNA:

* contamination: how solve?
    - sequence technician!
    - X chromosomes, mitchondria, why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
    - how can you tell the individual is male <strong style="font-size: 150%; color:     red;">?</strong>  
    - also sequenced 2nd dude, same signal
* mutations
	- deamination of cytosines gives C->T mutations
	- can try to correct for these, or ignore
* low copy and low quality sequence

Mitchondrial DNA good sequence (why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> )

* haplotype U: define **haplotype**
* this is found mostly in Europe not in Asia: some relation between MA-1 and Europe!

Y chromosome also gives haplotype (why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>)
* found to be more asian.  
* why different from mitochondria <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

Use f3 statistics to look for genetic similarity. Most similar to Americas and NE Europe!

Show possibilities: gene flow from NAM-M1 or MA-> NAM.  Why not NAM->M1 <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Because timing -- there were no NAM lineages at time.  

Show map.

What if due to recent European introgression?

Factor it in statistically.  Not all NAM would be equally related to M1 -- only those with admixture.  And M1 is clsoer to NAM than European. 

Conclusions:

Europe NAM shared ancestry from Siberian dudes.

mito haplotype in NAM related to Europeans

cranial structure

2nd dude showed people lived in siberian throughout ice age!
