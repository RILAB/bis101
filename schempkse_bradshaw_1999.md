## Intro 

Want to understand genetic basis of speciation

Explain Fisher's infinitessimal geometric model

Used two Mimulus, one bee and one bird pollinated. Cross and make F2.

Had previously mapped **QTL** for these traits.

#### Figure 1

So what do phenotypic ratios in this F2 tell you<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Not much, stuff is quantitative!

Show 5+ phenotypes.

Yup locus determines carotenoids. Orange/Red phenotype. Single locus dominant. Which F2 have it <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (DEKL)

## Methods

### 1995 Paper

93 F2 plants from Mc x Ml cross.

159 markers

Built linkage map from RF frequencies of markers.

Then correlated markers with phenotypes of interest.

#### Figure 2

Explain map on Fig 2. (like 4-13 in your book), and phenotpyic effects.

Close qtl = pleiotropy or linkage?

What does 1 QTL and 90% of variation tell you <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> If Mendelian why not 100% <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

#### Figure 3 

Look at distributions. 

* b shows dominance<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (YES)
* c shows transgressive segregation
* d shows C > L but not completeley dominant -- dominance is quantitative

### 1999 paper

Grew F2 plants in GH, measured.  Moved to field, watched for pollination. 

Looked for effect of phenotype on pollination.

Also genotyped at QTL and measured effect of QTL on pollination.

## Results

#### Figure 2

Error in graph colors.

Meaning of stars, positive regression coefficient (draw regression line) for area <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

Cheese on 11913. F1 not exact, but does suggest genetic basis. They could have (should have?) measured heritability.


#### Figure 3

Interpret <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

#### Figure 4

Add vs. dominant for QTL on nectar volume (pheno1) and visits per day (pheno2). Statistics and dominance interpretation in 4B.

Bees don't like red/orange, but hummingbird doesn't care. Hummingbird likes nectar, but bees don't care.

Even though these seem like really complicated traits (hummingbird preference), and you see lots of quantiative variation in F2, turns out only a few loci of large effect control most the variation.
