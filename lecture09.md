# BIS101 F2013 Lecture 9: DNA

## Reading

Ch. 16 Can Skip 16.5 on cancer if you want, but kinda neat

## Notes/Questions

DNA is the heritable material. Book goes into the clever experiments that showed this.

## Structure

DNA is pretty simple.

* phosphate
* doxyribose sugar
* four nitrogenous bases -- adenine guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil, and hypoxanthine
    - uracil and hypoxanthine mostly in RNA and tRNA

Purines: adenine and guanine
Pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine


**Nucleotide** is the combination of a base (ATGC) a doexyribose sugar, and a phophate group (draw 1)

DNA is double stranded with two strands of nuleotides wound together in double helix. It's a right-handed structure (show fist) although left-handed DNA exists (z-DNA) it is rare. Laugh at people who draw the helix wrong.

Backbone is made of phophate group of one nucleotide linked to ribose of the next. The two strands are held together how <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> hydrogen bonding.

A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C

But GC content varies among species. GC content higher in bacteria -- especially in archae living in thermal vents. Why <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  B/c G-C 3 H-bonds so are stronger, takes more energy (temp) to separate them

Direction on DNA is important. We will call one end 5' and the other end 3' -- these numbers come from the numbering of the carbon atoms of the doxyribose sugar. A molecule of DNA starst with phosphorylated 5' carbon and ends with hydroxyl group on a 3' carbon.

## Replication

Replication is semiconservative (meaning <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>) Each daughter DNA inherits 1 strand of original DNA + 1 new one

The helix is opened and unwound at the replication fork.  An enzyme called DNA polymerase III then adds nucloetides at the 3' end.  So DNA is syhtnesized 5'->3'.

Draw replication fork.  Anyone see problem with this? 

**Leading strand** gets continuous replication 
**Lagging strand** cannot. Polymerase has to stop, come back and start again.

But polymerase can't start a new DNA, only extend it.  So different enzyme sets down a **primer** a short strand of DNA that primes DNA sythesis.

DNA pol I removes primer via its exonuclease activity (nculease = ???), and then fills in gaps.
