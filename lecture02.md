Questions on lecture from yesterday? Mendel's First law:Equal segregation (which is?) Example: Ch. 2 # 41￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Example: Ch. 2 # 41In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a geneticist is interested in the development of trichomes (define). A large screen turns up two mutant plants (A and B) that have no trichomes, and these mutants seem to be potentially useful in studying trichome development. Each plant is crossed with wild type; in both cases, the next generation (F1) had normal trichomes. When F1 plants were selfed, the resulting F2’s were as follows:F2 from mutant A: 602 normal; 198 no trichomes F2 from mutant B: 267 normal; 93 no trichomesa. What do these results show? Include proposed genotypes of all plants in your answer.b. Under your explanation to part a, is it possible to confidently predict the F1 from crossing the original mutant A with the original mutant B?Mendel's Second Law:Independent assortment (which is?) (unlinked genes assort independently)￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼Independent assortment (which is?) (unlinked genes assort independently)Workthrough.Describe parents phenotype . Ask gametes. Ask F1. Draw Punnett square. Get phenotype s. Show monohybri d 3:1, dihybrid 9:3:3:1work out all 16 progeny, then can figure out phenotype based on whatyou know of dominant/recessive Predictions: probabilitytwo independent events -> multipleAaBb chance of getting an ab gamete? 1/4! AaBbCcDd -> 1⁄2^4 -> 1/16two mutually exclusive eventschance of getting A or a from AaBb (1) chance of getting AB, Ab, aB, or ab ? (1)Example: tb1-wt/tb1-ref;Wxy/wxy;adh1/adh1; which is dominant? (i didn't say)￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼which is dominant? (i didn't say)if I self, what's the chance of getting a tb1-ref/tb1-ref;wxy/wxy;adh1/ adh1 (1⁄2*1⁄2)*(1⁄2*1⁄2)=1/16=6.25%what's chance of getting tb1-ref/tb1-ref;wxy/wxy;adh1/Adh1 (0 unless mutation)how many progeny will i have to grow to get the genotype above @ 90% certainty?what's probability of not getting progeny i want (15/16)what's the probability of getting my progeny if I grow 3 plants?1-(15/16)^3=17.6% what if I grow n plants?1-(15/16)^nSo to get 90% certainty, I solve:1-(15/16)^n=0.9(15/16)^n=0.1n(ln(15/16))=ln(0.1) n=ln(0.1)/ln(0.9375)=35.7 -> 36 plantsReality never perfect (267 normal; 93 in problem above — not 270 vs. 90)so how know if close enough? Chi-squared test (responsible at least conceptually)i expect 270:90; i observe 267:93Sum((E-O)^2/E); compare to table with df (degrees freedom?)number of phenotypic classes -1 (here 1)sum = 0.13, 1 df,from table, to be significant at p=0.05 (i.e. <5% chance of observing data) need 3.841.so what do you conclude? (can't reject null hypothesis of expectation), that is 3:1 is an OK way of describing thisredo yourself with 244:104. should show the predicted ratio for 3:1 is: 261:87 (why not 270:90??)value is 4.43 -> reject 3:1 ratio!￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
value is 4.43 -> reject 3:1 ratio!Page 91-92 has nice text on the creation of pure lines using these probabilitiese.g. after 1 generation of selfing, a locus Aa has a 50% (what chance) chance of being homozygous?so after 8 generations 0.4% of all heterozygous cites in the genome should remain heterozygous (show yourself)heterosis = hybrid vigor (observed result, not well understood molecular basis)so why do offspring of hybrids suck? because they loseheterozygosity at 50% of loci!Polygenic inheritance: Mendelian & Quantitative traitsqualitative (red or green, wrinkled, round, etc. discrete states) usually simple genetic basis -- one or two genesquantitative traits (plant height, seed weight, #of trichomes, etc.) not discreteusually complex genetic basis -- many genes quant vs. qualearly history of genetics biometricians thought everything was quantitative and studying continuous diversity and Mendelians thought everything was single-gene discrete1918 Fisher showed the two things were the same RecombinationWe've done a lot with independent assortment — what assumption? what does that mean physically?things on different chromosomes, or far enough apartwhat about things that are close together — called linked sometimes will go together, sometimes apart —read up on ch. 4 for details￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
sometimes will go together, sometimes apart —read up on ch. 4 for detailspaper today uses identification of non-independent assortment to place genes on same chromosome arms￼
