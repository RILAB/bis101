# BIS101 F2014: lecture 16 Forward and Reverse Genetics


## Forward vs. reverse genetics


* draw phenotype & genotype w/ arrows
* forward: no prior genetic knowledge required
 	- forward: requires lots of mutagenesis and screening
* reverse: need to "know" locus
	- only gets @ effect of 1 gene

Mutagenesis important for both approaches

* chemical -- EMS, high rate, usually hypomorph/hypermorph
	* alylates G's, leading to G||C A||T mutation (transition<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> )
* physical -- radiation, medium, usually loss of fxn, rearrangement
* biological -- TEs, low, can be loss of fxn in gene or hypomorph in reg. how could you make mutants with TEs <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Ac/Ds

Often make mutant "libraries" of lines of mouse or rice or whatever with known mutations. Broad use to community. 

### Forward: "phenotype forward"

Identify strange phenotype. From nature or often from mutant libraries.

Identify mode of action.  How<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> crosses (either with Natural mutant or artificial one)  

* why are dominant mutations rare<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  (most will be loss of function or hypomorphic)  
* advantage of haploid organisms? (all mutations seen)  
* if multiple mutants, do mutations complement? same vs. different.  
* under what conditions does mutation have effect? gets at function?
	
Map mutant

* QTL mapping & fine mapping
* what needed <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> genetic map, physical map (reference genome sequence) to put it in context with other genes

Test candidate loci: 

* do they have differences from WT (nonsyn etc.). <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> PCR and sequence
* look for size differences (indels etc.) <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> PCR
* Show expression diffs? (how measure<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> RNAseq or qPCR or Northern)

## Reverse

Start with locus of interest. Want to know what it does.

What does sequence tell us <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Important domains, shared promotoers, etc.

e.g. we can see it has a zinc-finger-domain, so we know it binds DNA.

Mutagenize and look for fxn.

* knockout or knockdown (how do latter<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> RNAi)
* CRIPS/CAS editing

Where/when is it expressed?

* RNAseq in different tissues.
* Transform promoter/enhancer w/ reporter gene (example<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> tb1 transient assay)
* in situ hybridization: label DNA/RNA and see in what tissues it hybridizes

Levels of protein: 

* Western blots

If protein interacts with DNA<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Chip-seq (redraw?)

If it's DNA sequence how can we tell methylation status<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  

* bisulfite sequencing (methlyated C's protected)
* methylation sensitive restriction enzymes
