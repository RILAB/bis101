## Gene regulation possibilities

constitutive? (always on) vs regulated: 

transcriptional regulation can affect 1) initiation 2) amount

* **Activator**
 	- binds to activator binding site on DNA (on or near promoter region, or in enhancer sites in eukaryotes)
	- facilitate binding of RNA polymerase and initiate transcription
	- can require binding of an **effector**
	- **allosteric domain** and conformation change
   - **inhibitor** can prevent from binding
* **Repressor**
	- binds to control sequence called an **operator** and prevents transcription
	- **corepressor** molecule can be required for binding
	- **inducer** molecule can prevent from binding

Gene: What is a gene<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

Fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity which carries information from one generation to the next

A segment of DNA, composed of a transcribed region and usually a regulatory sequence that makes possible transcription.
    
What is an operon <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> a group of genes that are coregulated.  Each codes for a separate product, but all share common transcription and regulation.

makes for efficient regulation of a system or pathway

polycistronic transcription (vs. monocistronic): makes multiple proteins from same transcript; common in bacteria, rare in eukaryotes

## lac operon

normally E. coli uses glucose for metabolism

lac operon is inducible -- normally not highly expressed, doesn't take up or use lactose
    in absence of glucose, lac+ (wild type) can induce expression of operon to use lactose

genes:
	lacZ lacY lacA are protein-coding DNA
	lacP and lacO are binding sites
	lacI is protein coding but no part of operon
        permease lacY allows lactose in
        lactose -> galactose + glucose by enzyme beta-galactosidase (lacZ)
            occasionally produces allolactose 
        lacA transacetylase -> not well known but perhaps transfer acetyl group from nonmetabolizeable sugars so as to prevent reentry into cell?
        regulatory vs. structural genes
        lacP promotor
        CAP binding site binds CAP-CAMP complex
            catabolite activator protein (CAP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (signal transduction)
            bends DNA to open for RNA pol and ++ expression
            positive or negative regulation? (positive)
            glycolisis? (metabolic pathway get energy from glucose) reduces availability of cAMP, keeping expression low
        lacP and CAP negative or positive bp (negative)
            cis or trans (cis)?
Glucose, no lactose figure
    lacI repressor protein binds to lacO operator
        allolactuse functions as inducer
        lacO actually overlaps transcript
    lacI operate cis or trans? (trans)
    mutations in lacO cis or trans (cis)
Lactose, no glucose figure
    RNA pol binds to lacP promoter (misleading figure)
    negative or positively regulated? (negative)
    cAMP abundant, CAP-cAMP open DNA -> lots of transcription
    Glucose, lactose?
        cAMP very limited, so low expression of operon
        allolactose inducer may be present, no binding of repressor
    Problem?
        need lactose to get started, but from where?
        repressor falls off occasionally!
Mutants of lac operon
    complementation (?) could be done how?go through mutants
    I+ wild type
    Oc repressor can't bind
        effect? constitutive expression of lac operon (cis/trans?)
    I- repressor can't bind
         what if another copy on F' with I+? (binds fine)
        so in a merodiploid is I+ dominant or recessive? (dominant b/c trans)
    Go over Fâ€™ I+P+OcZ-Y+A+/ I+P+O+Z+Y-A+
        F' can't make galactosidase, bacteria can't make perm ease. neither functions
        F' also constitutively expressed b/c can't bind promoter.
        het functions normally -> constitutive expression of permease, inducible expression of galactosidase
Attenuation of tryp operon
    makes amino acid tryptophan
has repressor-cosupressor model (tryptophan is corepressor, needed to bind & repress)
    but instead of just on/off like lac, has dimmer switch
    4 repeat regions which can bind to form loops
    tryp needed to make 14-AA polypeptide at beginning
    lots of tryp:
        ribosome stops at small stop codon and is on top of 1&2, loop 3-4 forms and terminates transcription of polymerase (as standard model, poly-U)
    little tryp:
        ribosome stalls in 1 b/c can't make it through tryp AAs.  stalled ribosome let 2-3 mRNA loop form
Hawaiian bobtail squid
    bioluminescescent underbelly to be camouflaged at night against starry/moonlight sky
    contains special organs to capture and cultivate Alivibrio fischeri bacteria
    A. fischeri lux operon is expressed under glucose starvation (CAMP binding site)
    bidirectional transcription between I & R
    also binding site for transcription activator luxR, which only binds when bound to its effector luxI
    luxI protein secreted from cell. a single cell doesn't produce enough luxI to bioluminesce (free-living A. fischeri don't!)
    when cells are concentrated, enough luxI produced -> feedback loop
    also weak binding site for luxR in luxD -> causes negative regulation of luxI via DNA loop formation w/operator not well understood (turning down luxR expression)
Lytic vs. lysogenic life cycle
    some can do both
    normally integrated phage not expressed, just along for ride
    cholera, diphtheria, botulism, dysentery by this method
