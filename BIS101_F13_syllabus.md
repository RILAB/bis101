##Text
**Required:** Griffiths A, Wessler SR, Carroll SB, and Doebley J. Introduction to Genetic Analysis. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. 10th Edition.

The 9th edition of this book is similar, but is missing important new chapters in population and quantitative genetics. It also likely has different homework problems. Therefore, the 10th edition is strongly recommended.


##Lectures

Lectures will predominantly be on the chalkboard. Text copies of Dr. Ross-Ibarra's lecture notes can be found on [github](https://github.com/rossibarra/bis101). While you are welcome to use these notes, they are subject to change and correction and will not be posted on any regular schedule.  They are not intended as a student aid. 


Lectures will consist of ~70 minutes of lecture, followed by a 5 minute break. Each class, after the break, we will discuss part of a paper on genetics from the primary scientific literature.

## Grading

Grading in the course will consist of two exams, homework, and class participation as follows:

* Exam 1: 100 pts
* Exam 2: 100 pts
* Homework: 50 pts
* Class participation: 5 pts

Grading will be a on a strict curve, such that the top 15% of students will get an A, the next 25% a B, the next 40% a C, and the remaining 20% D or F.

![Grading Curve](./curve.pdf "Grading Curve")

## Exams
Both exams will be take-home exams. Your textbook, the internet, and your notes are all acceptable sources of information for the takehome exam, but discussion of the exam or collaboration with other students is not acceptable. Electronic copies of the exam must be turned in via SmartSite. The second exam is not cumulative. Exam dates are in the course outline below. 

Exams will consist primarily (~3/4) of material from the lecture and secondarily (~1/4) of material from discussion of the research papers.

If you feel that your exam grade is in error, you may ask for a regrade. At the TA's discretion your entire exam may be regraded, and experience shows students often lose points upon regrade; it is thus not advised to ask for a regrade unless you believe an actual error was made during grading. Due to constraints of turning in grades at the end of the quarter, thre are no regrades on the second exam.

## Homework
Each week's homework will be assigned the Thursday prior. Homework is due during your discussion period the following week. Each homework assignment is worth 5 points; full credit will be given for each correct answer where your work is shown. No partial credit is given and there are no regrades on homework.

##Class Participation

At the beginning of each class the TAs will write on the board the names of 15 students. Those students will be asked to sit in the front row during the class period, and will be handed 3x5 cards.  During the break those students will turn in the 3x5 card (with name and student ID) with a question relevant to the research paper being discussed that day. Given the size of the class and number of students, each student will be asked to sit in the front row once during the course of the quarter. Your 5 points of class participation will be based on the question submitted.

##Academic honesty
Any form of cheating on examinations will not be tolerated. Consultation with other students on the exam is not allowed. If you use materials from published sources they must be cited. All assignments should be completed within the time stated and unfounded excuses to receive an extension are not acceptable. For a full understanding of the UC Code of Academic Conduct please go to the Student Judicial Affairs website: http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html.

## Email Policy
Formal and professional conduct is expected of you at all times. Email, as a form of professional communication (unlike text messaging), is no exception. Email must come from your UCD email (the one ending in ucdavis.edu). Emails must have a subject line that includes the subject of the message and the name of the class (BIS 101), and must be formally addressed. Emails that do not follow these guidelines run the risk of being ignored or deleted. We will make every effort to answer emails in a timely fashion.

## BIS 101D:
If you have enrolled in BIS 101D, you must attend the session in which you registered. Please make sure that you registered for sections accompanying BIS 101-002. These are sections BIS 101D-020 to 025. If you have registered for any other section, please reregister for one of these sections. Grading for these sections will be P/NP and determined by the instructor of your section.
