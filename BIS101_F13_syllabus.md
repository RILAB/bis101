##Text**Required:** Griffiths A, Wessler SR, Carroll SB, and Doebley J. Introduction to Genetic Analysis. New York: W.H. Freeman, 2012. 10th Edition.

The 9th edition of this book is similar, but is missing important new chapters in population and quantitative genetics. It also likely has different homework problems. Therefore, the 10th edition is strongly recommended.

##Lectures
Lectures will predominantly be on the chalkboard. Text copies of Dr. Ross-Ibarra's lecture notes can be found on [github](https://github.com/rossibarra/bis101). While you The instructors will use overhead illustrations during lectures. PDF files of the illustrations will be posted before each lecture on the BIS 101-003 SmartSite. These files will be called “Lecture Notes” and will be numbered as in the Course Outline below. Please bring them with you and use them as your class notes. Illustrations are deliberately incomplete. They will be used by the instructors as a framework for a lecture. After each lecture, the completed illustrations will be further annotate by the instructors and made available to you on the BIS 101-003 SmartSite in folder “Annotated lecture notes”. Please compare the annotated illustrations with your own lecture notes and note additional information added by the instructors.## GradingGrading in the course will consist of two exams, homework, and class participation as follows:
* Exam 1: 100 pts
* Exam 2: 100 pts* Homework: 50 pts

Formal and professional conduct is expected of you at all times. Email, as a form of professional communication (unlike text messaging), is no exception. Email must come from your UCD email (the one ending in ucdavis.edu). Emails must have a subject line that includes the subject of the message and the name of the class (BIS 101), and must be formally addressed. Emails that do not follow these guidelines run the risk of being ignored or deleted. We will make every effort to answer emails in a timely fashion.
## BIS 101D:If you have enrolled in BIS 101D, you must attend the session in which you registered. Please make sure that you registered for sections accompanying BIS 101-002. These are sections BIS 101D-020 to 025. If you have registered for any other section, please reregister for one of these sections. Grading for these sections will be P/NP and determined by the instructor of your section.
