## Q1

In the merodiploid

   P+O+I_1 Z+Y-A+
F' P+O+I_2 Z-Y+A+

If I_1 has a mutation that cannot bind allolactose, and I_2 has a mutation that it cannot bind DNA, will this cell be able to make beta-gal in the presence of lactose, glucose?

	no lactose, no glucose


## Q2 

Draw a gene with a mutation 30bp upstream of the transcription start stie.

## Q3

**Gal4**

If you generated a reporter gene construct with a gal4 binding site upstream of a GFP gene, and introduced it into yeast on a YAC, would you expect to see GFP fluorescence in the presence of galactose? Assume all wt yeast genes are present.

		Yes, GFP should be transcribed and translated, as the gal4 activation domain will be released (by galactose/gal3 modifying gal80) and gal4 will be active, and enhance transcription of the GFP gene. 

## Q4

If eukaryotic genomes (50 Mb-1000's of Mb) are on average larger than prokaryotic genomes (<10 Mb), why is chromatin and DNA packaging important?

	Chromatin helps with packing large amounts of DNA into the nucleus, and also provides regulatory control.


## Q5 

In a common garden study all of the variation for a phenotype of interst is shown to be epigenetic changes that are not heritable. Would this population respond to selection?  Why or why not?
