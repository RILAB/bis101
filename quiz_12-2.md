#Q1 **RT-PCR review**

You are interested in sequencing the mRNA from the following gene. 

mRNA 5' CTATGATCTAAGATG 3'

You use a primer with many T's that binds to the polyA tail. Draw the DNA molecule made from the reverse transcription reaction (including the primer), and label the 5' and 3' ends.

	5' TTTTTTTTTTCATCTTAGATCATAG 3' 

#Q2 **translation**

In the above mRNA, assuming translation begins at the first start codon, how many amino acids are encoded?

	The codons are ATG ATC TAA, so two amino acids are encoded.

#Q3 **Mutation**

Curly frizzled feathers in chickens are caused by a mutation to KRT75, a gene that codes for alpha-keratin. This mutation results in a 69 bp deletion in the KRT75 mRNA. Will this deletion shift the reading frame of KRT75? How might this deletion cause frizzled feathers?

	This deletion will not shift the reading frame, as it's a multiple of 3. It would delete 23 amino acids from the protein. This might remove an important structural domain of the protein (specifically, a coiled-coil domain of alpha-keratin, which probably disrupts dimerization of keratin molecules).

#Q4 **mutation**

 A precancerous mutation occurs in Jim Bob Jane Doe’s lung cell due to chronic exposure to tobacco. One year later, Jim Bob Jane Doe has a son. Will this precancerous mutation be inherited by it’s son? Why or why not?

It will not be inherited because the mutation occurred in a somatic cell. Mutations need to occur in gamete-forming cells to enter the germ-line.



#Q 6 **Repair**

Why is NHEJ used most of the time in higher eukaryotes (vs. HR)?

	HR mostly occurs during the when cells are replicating their DNA. However, cells of higher eukaryotes are not usually replicating their DNA, and there are not any unaltered, identical DNA templates available for HR. NHEJ can also be used as a quick emergency repair system, even though it can lead to mutation.
