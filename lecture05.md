#BIS101 F2013 Lecture 5: Quantitative Traits

Polygenic inheritance: Mendelian & Quantitative traitsqualitative (red or green, wrinkled, round, etc. discrete states) usually simple genetic basis -- one or two genesquantitative traits (plant height, seed weight, #of trichomes, etc.) not discreteusually complex genetic basis -- many genes quant vs. qualearly history of genetics biometricians thought everything was quantitative and studying continuous diversity and Mendelians thought everything was single-gene discrete1918 Fisher showed the two things were the same

treat as discrete trait. tall vs. shortcodominant -- additive -- so each A contributes 1 cm to height aa plants are 5cm tall, Aa 6, AA 7 -- so 3 possible heights and one way to get each (draw as # ways)so what would dominant A look like?aa 5cm Aa 7cm AA 7cmnow make two genes, both additive, each adds 1A locus, B locus (make table of genotype, phenotype)￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
