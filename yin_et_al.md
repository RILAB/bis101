## Yin et al

mouse mutant. What's the mutation <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

	mutation in FAH fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). accumulates tyrosine. Another enzyme HPD breaks down certain forms of tyrosine -> liver damage.
	
What is the molecular basis of mutation?

	Turns out a G is common for bp right before intron.  G->A in this case prevents splciing start, so exon 8 is left out.

What does NTBC do ???

	Drug that inhibits HPD and prevents acute liver damage. 
	
Previous work<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

	used a viral vector to repair FAH. repaired liver cells grow and divide, restoring liver function. but required rounds of NTBC withdrawal and recovery

What'd they do?

	CRISPR-CAS with 3 different guide RNAs. FAH1,2,3

Experimental control?

	Inject wiht 1) saline 2) only DNA 3) DNA plus Cas9 (enzyme that does the work) 4) DNA + Cas9 + guide RNAs

Go over Fig. 1


How confirm<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

	RT-PCR reverse transcriptase. RNA->DNA. found two bands, one corresponding to truncated RNA, one to WT (Fig. 2b)
	Sequenced PCR product to show G is back
	
	Immuno-staining of liver cells

Sequencing not work. Why<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
	
	correct DNA small set of total DNA, hard to detect

What about side effects<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

	normal mice with injection, no problem
	off target-effects -- did it edit somewhere else in genome<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> no evidence		


Why diff in Fig. 2a?

	with NTBC mutant cells can survive
	
First use of CRISPR-CAS to edit the genome of an adult mammal!  Cool the future is here!

Wait: how to target other tissues? Liver gets blood, so easy.

How to regenerate other tissues? Liver regenerates automagically.

So injection won't work for other tissues/problems.  But still cool!
