## Intro

Define sexual selection. Two kinds

What's the paradox <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> That there is any variation left!

What are hypotheses <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

* Good genes: traits reflect overall condition, thus lots of genes contribute. Can't fix 'em all.

* sexually antagonistic selection: selection different in two sexes.

* alternatively sex. traits may be bad for survival: sure that huge tail makes you more attractive for the ladies (peacocks here), but also makes it easier for octopuses or whatever eats peacocks to see you.

Sheep!

* h^2 is substantial (~0.4) for horn size. what does this mean <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> selection should be able to work!

* horn type and length had been mapped to single locus on chr10. they then identified the gene.

* explain genotypes. Ho+ normal, long. HoP small, wi/ ~50% of HoP/HoP scurred.

* genotypes of fig1?

* What does it mean that Ho contributes only 76% of Va <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  Quant. trait.

## Methods

5880 sheep 

reproductive success 

* genotyped at 50K SNPs (what's a SNP<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> )

* used relatedness from SNPs to construct pedigree!

* paternity tests.

* repro success and survivorship from field data from 30 years!

Ho genotype

* 1750 sheep w/ repro success info genotyped at SNP in LD with Ho (explain <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> )

change over time - balancing selection?

* did some modeling and stats (we will ignore)
* simulations on pedigree -- put random alleles at same freq. and see how change over time.

## Results

Reproductive fitness of Ho+/Ho+ males <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Highes, with hets intermediate.

Survival fitness of Ho+/Ho+ males <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Highes, with hets intermediate.

What about in females <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> nothing.

So can sex. antagonistic explain <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> no

Can gene capture (sex trait as sign of total fitness) explain <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> no because big horns die more. also single gene.

Can genetic drift explain <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> No, they previously estimated effective population size at 194. 

How did they rule out directional selection ??? (could be that sex adv. > death disadv.)

Why is over dominance (het advantage) rare <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> 

What's their theory <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> energy expenditure.
