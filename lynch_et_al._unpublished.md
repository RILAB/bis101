Interested in studying placental evoluition and origin of novel phenotypes.

Define oviparous.

Explain 3 major differences (page 3 bottom)

## Data

A bunch of transcriptomes (which are <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>) from several mammal groups. 

What tissues do they need<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Endometrium, innermost gladular layer of mammalian uterus.  

Why not placenta directly<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Not all mammals have placenta! 

Use RNAseq data to identify expression presence or absence of gene in endometrium.  How <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

Also later use RNA-seq to identify TSS. How <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>

Then how identify branches on tree wher elots of gene expression change. <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Parsimony. For each gene parsimony to identifiy changes, then sum over genes. **Show example**

Methods: "phylogenetic footprinting": fancy way of saying "regions that stayed the same" to identify enhancers etc.

Explain Chip-chip and chip-seq. Use antibodies to methylated histones. Crosslink to DNA, digest, sequence (seq) / hybridize (chip) and see what's there.

hesc -- can cehmically treat human embryonic stem cells to make the decidualized -- effectively turn them into endometrial tissue.  Same as endometrium <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> No, but pretty good, and easier to do than chopping up human endometrium!

H3K4me3 -- trymethlyation of histone 3 lysine #4 -- mark of poised (ready) promoters).

H3k27me3 -- trymethylation of histone 3 lysine #27 -- mark of poised (ready) enhancers

## Results

Found rates vary (Fig. 1A), highest on lineages leading up to major changes.

No strong evidence for selection on those genes (1D). How test for selection <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Dn/ds

Genes showing evidence of recruitment enriched or not (yes) for knockouts <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  What does this suggest about results <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  If a knockout in mouse has a pregnancy-related disease, more likely to function pregnancy in humans! 

Annotation of genes. Used KEGG pathways (database). Example (p. 6) of kinase genes (what do kinases do <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>) suggesting importance of signalling. Discuss validity.

#### Hand2

Hand2 a transcription factor (which is<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>) that plays role in progestorine activity and suppression of estrogen activity.

Hand2 expression represses estrogen-mediated expression of MUC1.  MUC1 expression mimics invasive placentation (how deply placenta fuses with endometrium) in mammals. How so <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> In most placental mammals but lost in hoofed mammals. This interpreted as additional ev. these genes play a role and that estrogen signaling an ancestral character. Causal <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> No.

Hand2 recruitment correlates with new cis-regulatory site for a CTCF insulator protein.  New site also perfectly delineates active and silent chromatin -- recruitment was due to modification of chromatin to allow expression of hand2. **Draw gene upstream/downstream and expression in Eutherians and other mammals**

#### AHR

AHR also regulates effect of estrogen via downregulation of estrogen receptor ESR1.  Looked for AHR binding sites near/around ESR1 that were only in eutherian mammals. 

Test if AHR regulates ESR1.  Add TCDD -> increase AHR expression, decrease ESR1 expression (check). (Figure 4E). in presence of AHR siRNA (which is <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> ) what would we expect?? no AHR functioning, no effect on ESR1. Confirms regulatory role for AHR.

Then made fake construct with luciferase, showed that mutating AHR site of LINE element abolished repression effect (proving it's the binding site of the AHR that does the trick).

Identified AHR binding site created by insertion of LINE element in intron of ESR1. Fig. 4D shows conservation (light gray poorly conserved). 

So AHR expression change due to new enhancer brought in by TE. Binding of AHR also changed due to TE.

Found that lots of AHR sites are in TEs, suggesting TE movement has re-wired the network controlled by this transcription factor!

#### TEs!

Identify TSS of all genes recruited during each phase. How <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Assemble sequence of RNA -> get mRNA sequence. Beginning of mRNA = TSS. Show 5C. What are diff. diagnoal lines <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Alternate splicing.

Looked for all "poised" enhancers in human embryonic stem cell tissue that has been turned into endometrial tissue ("decidulaized hESC") via application of hormones.  How<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Chip for H3K27me3 sites.

What find <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Majority of all recruited genes could be associated with TEs-derived enhancer. 

Breakdown of kinds of TEs similar among genes recruited at different time periods. They argue this means TE could be older than change of expression. Lame. How could they test this explicitly <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> (age of TE insertions!!)

Also did same for promoters based on H3K4me3 Chip data; again find majority overlap with TE annotations.  

Compared TE-promoters and TE-enhancers in decidualized hESC w/ those from 9 other cell types.  Lots shared, but fewer enhancers, suggesting enhancers are more tisse-specific. Makes sense if TEs actually include binding sites for TFs like AHR.

## Discussion

What do they show about quantitative changes in expression <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Nothing. Is this likely important <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Sure. Why not evaluate <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Harder to do!

Decoupling of insertion and co-option.  I.e. element inserted not always immediately promoter/enhancer.

Bursts of TE caused by stress might facilitate adaptation.  Not a lot of theory for this. 


## Criticisms

Timing of TEs could be better done.

Figures are terrible and impenetrable and not well explained.

Too much stuff early on on pathways and selection.  Also too much detail on a few genes.  Should have mentioned those genes, dumped to supplement, and talked more about overall TEs.

Not great job differentiating endometrium from all promoters/enhancers. If all show majority and 60-80% are shared in other tissues, hard to know how specific this is for "adaptation for preganancy". Would be better to go into more detail here. Combine with age, look at recruitment in other tissues along phylogeny, etc.

End with Lame stuff on cancer and immunity link via AHR. Not well developed and should have dropped.
