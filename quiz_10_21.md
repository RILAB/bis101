# Q1 **Heritability**

Blackberries grow clonally, so each plant in a patch has the same genotype at every locus in the genome. You head out to your favorite patch, and measure the number of fruits on each plant. You find 10 plants with 9 berries, 10 plants with 10 berries, and 10 plants with 11 berries. What is the phenotypic variance for berry number?

	mean=10 berries
	Vp = sum( (pheno - mean)^2 ) / n
	Vp = (10*(1)^2 + 10*(0) + 10*(1)^2) /30 = 0.67

# Q2 **Heritability, continued**

What is the broad-sense heritability for fruit number in this patch of blackberries?

	h^2=0 because there is no genetic variance. All plants have the same genotype.

# Q3 **Lecture 6, population frequencies**

You wander into a mountain meadow, and notice that for one species of slimy sand fly, there are some individuals with blue stripes, and others with black stripes. You count the plants, and find that 3/4 of the slimy sand flies are blue-striped, and 1/4 are black-striped,. You know stripe color is monogenic and Mendelian in these flies. Can you identify which allele is dominant? If so, which is dominant and why? 

	Can't identify which is dominant. Need to cross a true-breeding blue fly with a true-	breeding black fly, and see what the F1 looks like. If F1 are blue, blue allele is 	dominant. If this is the case, when selfed, we'd expect a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the 	F2. The blue allele could be recessive, but at high frequency in the population.

# Q4 Allele Frequencies 

In sweet peas, the pea shape phenotype is monogenic. When a round pea is crossed to a trapezoidal pea, you see 3:1 round:trapezoidal.  You sample a natural population and find that trapezoidal peas make up 36% of the population.  If peas are in HWE, What is the frequency of the "r" allele?

	Since frequency of rr is 36%, q2 = 0.36.
	If q2 = 0.36, then q = 0.6. 
	Since q = f(r) = 0.6 (or 60%).


# Q5 **Paper Question**

Sheep with the Ho^p/Ho^p genotype do not always have scurred horns. Are scurred horns a fully penetrant trait (i.e., penetrance=1)? 

	No, around half of individuals with the Ho^p/Ho^p genotype develop scurs.
