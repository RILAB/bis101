## Q1

**Chromatin**

You identify a potential enhancer in humans by finding a 200 bp sequence that is conserved across all mammals. You examine the chromatin state of the enhancer in skin cells, and find that it is closed, suggesting the gene is not expressed. Should you conclude this is not an enhancer? If no, what further tests could you do?

	Not sufficient evidence to give up. Check out the chromatin state in another cell type. Maybe this is a regulatory element for a gene that is expressed in a different cell type.


## Q2

If eukaryotic genomes (50 Mb-1000's of Mb) are on average larger than prokaryotic genomes (<10 Mb), why is chromatin and DNA packaging important?

	Chromatin helps with packing large amounts of DNA into the nucleus, and also provides regulatory control.


## Q3 

In a common garden study all of the variation for a phenotype of interst is shown to be epigenetic changes that are not heritable. Would this population respond to selection?  Why or why not?

	No, no Va

## Q4

A mutation is found in a tRNA- encoding gene. The wild type allele produces a tRNA that recognizes the codon GAA, and is charged with the amino acid Glutamic acid. The mutant tRNA is still charged with Glu, but the anticodon is mutated such that it recognizes the codon TAA. What effect will this have on translation in these cells? How will the proteins produced be different?

	The codon TAA is a stop codon. In the mutant cells, the stop codon TAA will sometimes be bound by the mutant tRNA charged with glutamic acid. In this case, the polypeptide synthesis will continue past the stop codon and the protein made will be longer than normal.

## Q 5


Why might skipping exon 8 of FAH be bad? Provide two reasons why.

	The junction between exons 7 and 9 may introduce a premature stop codon leading to a truncated protein, the protein may be misfolded and unable to function, the mRNA might be recognized by different silencing mechanisms, the mRNA might be subject to nonsense mediated decay.
