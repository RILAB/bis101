## Genetics

### Definitions

<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Gene (draw example)

* a piece of DNA that encodes transcribed sequence (and linked regulatory stuff)
* regulatory elements (such as?) what about regulatory elements far away? (tb1 example)
 
$\bf\large?$ Locus

* a particular region of DNA of interest

<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Allele

* a particular variant at a locus

<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Phenotype

* what something looks like (molecular, morphology, enzyme, etc.)

<strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Genotype

* alleles at a locus or loci of interest (including whole genome)

Omes: Genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc.

* lots of bad omes: "connectome" -- map of synapses and neurons etc.

## Organization & Ploidy

####Basic 
Gene DNA -> transcription -> RNA -> translation -> protein -> stuff happens

Genes in order along chromosomes
        fig. 1-7 (gene spacing)
        draw genes along dna in maize, w/ lots of TEs
        
        will discuss more on genome organization later
    genes in DNA -> wrapped around nucleosomes -> organized into chromatin -> chromosomes
    draw chromosome X, show centromere telomere
    why draw as an X? -> two copies of same come, one from mom one from dad -> homologs or homologous csomes
    why 2? diploid
        haploid? tetraploid? define polyploid
        n=haploid number
        x=basal number
        2n=2x=20 in maize (how many different csomes?)
        2n=2x=46 in humans?
        2n=6x=42 in wheat?  explain?  hexaploid, what's the base number?  what would a diploid have?
Crosses
    fundamental to lots of genetic analysis
    understand gene action, segregation, dissect genotypes
    usually consider diploid individuals
    two alleles at the locus, written with abbreviations
        Aa BgBg etc.  Big A ≠ dominant!
        define: heterozygote, homozygote
    draw cross Bb x BB
        we'll call the brown locus, with alleles B and b
        if B is a mutation that creates a failed protein, we can have a Bb genotype
            if Bb is functional, the gene is haplosufficient 
            if Bb is nonfunctional — fails to produce protein or do something, the gene is haploinsufficient
            what's a mutation?
                any change to the DNA sequence 
                    nucleotide change (creates a SNP)
                    insertion/deletion (creates an indel)
                    Transposon
                    duplication, inversion, translocation, etc. etc. (will cover later)
        Mendel's first law of equal segregation 50% B 50% b
        if we assume b dominant to B
            what's dominant mean? 
            recessive? 
            codominant?
        label parental, fileal generation
        test cross of some line to a homozygous recessive (the tester)
            NOT the same as a tester in plant breeding necessarily
        monoybrid cross? two hets. (say, two F1's)
        are all F1's alike?  
        ratios to remember  (show punnet square)
            3:1 (Bb X Bb) -- BB 2Bb bb   — single locus, 1 allele dominant in monohybrid cross
            1:1 (Bb X BB) — test cross, single locus, 1 allele dominant
            1:2:1 (Bb X Bb) — codominant or incomplete dominant monohybrid cross (red, pink, white)
            Note that the 3:1 PHENOTYPE ratio is actually a 1:2:1 GENOTYPE ratio
    Know your mitosis and meiosis (not covering it here)
Other forms of inhertiance:
    organellar
        mitochrondria — respiration?
            almost always maternal
        chloroplast -- photosynthesis?
            almost always maternal (paternal in conifers)
    Sex linked
        humans have X and Y
            how passed on?
            some plants have sex chromosomes!
            Silene laitfolia (XX female, XY male) — even sexually transmitted disease which is a smut fungus travels on pollen
            even plants without sex chromosomes have sexes
                hermaphroditic
                monoecious — one house (separate flowers, same plant)
                dioecious — two houses (separate flowers, separate plants)
                gynodioecious — females and hermaphrodites
Don't worry too much about sex-linkage, pedigree analysis, or and nothing about human/drosophila/etc will be on the test.


Lecture 2: Ch. 3 Mendel
Book should be on reserve now at library
also added Raven "Biology of Plants". Ch. 3, 8-12 are the most relevant for this class (but may be a while to be included)
Messages tool online to help exchange info for your discussion partner Answers for today's discussion — about 1/3 of you didn't post — easy points
Office hours — nobody came, different time (I said wrong time in class on Monday)
Schedule will be somewhat fluid until last set of folks add/drop Fewer students -> fewer discussions (none on midterms)
Questions on lecture from yesterday? Mendel's First law:
Equal segregation (which is?) Example: Ch. 2 # 41
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Example: Ch. 2 # 41
In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a geneticist is interested in the development of trichomes (define). A large screen turns up two mutant plants (A and B) that have no trichomes, and these mutants seem to be potentially useful in studying trichome development. Each plant is crossed with wild type; in both cases, the next generation (F1) had normal trichomes. When F1 plants were selfed, the resulting F2’s were as follows:
F2 from mutant A: 602 normal; 198 no trichomes F2 from mutant B: 267 normal; 93 no trichomes
a. What do these results show? Include proposed genotypes of all plants in your answer.
b. Under your explanation to part a, is it possible to confidently predict the F1 from crossing the original mutant A with the original mutant B?
Mendel's Second Law:
Independent assortment (which is?) (unlinked genes assort independently)
￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼Independent assortment (which is?) (unlinked genes assort independently)
Work
through.
Describe parents phenotype . Ask gametes. Ask F1. Draw Punnett square. Get phenotype s. Show monohybri d 3:1, dihybrid 9:3:3:1
work out all 16 progeny, then can figure out phenotype based on what
you know of dominant/recessive Predictions: probability
two independent events -> multiple
AaBb chance of getting an ab gamete? 1/4! AaBbCcDd -> 1⁄2^4 -> 1/16
two mutually exclusive events
chance of getting A or a from AaBb (1) chance of getting AB, Ab, aB, or ab ? (1)
Example: tb1-wt/tb1-ref;Wxy/wxy;adh1/adh1; which is dominant? (i didn't say)
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼which is dominant? (i didn't say)
if I self, what's the chance of getting a tb1-ref/tb1-ref;wxy/wxy;adh1/ adh1 (1⁄2*1⁄2)*(1⁄2*1⁄2)=1/16=6.25%
what's chance of getting tb1-ref/tb1-ref;wxy/wxy;adh1/Adh1 (0 unless mutation)
how many progeny will i have to grow to get the genotype above @ 90% certainty?
what's probability of not getting progeny i want (15/16)
what's the probability of getting my progeny if I grow 3 plants?
1-(15/16)^3=17.6% what if I grow n plants?
1-(15/16)^n
So to get 90% certainty, I solve:
1-(15/16)^n=0.9
(15/16)^n=0.1
n(ln(15/16))=ln(0.1) n=ln(0.1)/ln(0.9375)=35.7 -> 36 plants
Reality never perfect (267 normal; 93 in problem above — not 270 vs. 90)
so how know if close enough? Chi-squared test (responsible at least conceptually)
i expect 270:90; i observe 267:93
Sum((E-O)^2/E); compare to table with df (degrees freedom?)
number of phenotypic classes -1 (here 1)
sum = 0.13, 1 df,
from table, to be significant at p=0.05 (i.e. <5% chance of observing data) need 3.841.
so what do you conclude? (can't reject null hypothesis of expectation), that is 3:1 is an OK way of describing this
redo yourself with 244:104. should show the predicted ratio for 3:1 is: 261:87 (why not 270:90??)
value is 4.43 -> reject 3:1 ratio!
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
value is 4.43 -> reject 3:1 ratio!
Page 91-92 has nice text on the creation of pure lines using these probabilities
e.g. after 1 generation of selfing, a locus Aa has a 50% (what chance) chance of being homozygous?
so after 8 generations 0.4% of all heterozygous cites in the genome should remain heterozygous (show yourself)
heterosis = hybrid vigor (observed result, not well understood molecular basis)
so why do offspring of hybrids suck? because they lose
heterozygosity at 50% of loci!
Polygenic inheritance: Mendelian & Quantitative traits
qualitative (red or green, wrinkled, round, etc. discrete states) usually simple genetic basis -- one or two genes
quantitative traits (plant height, seed weight, #of trichomes, etc.) not discrete
usually complex genetic basis -- many genes quant vs. qual
early history of genetics biometricians thought everything was quantitative and studying continuous diversity and Mendelians thought everything was single-gene discrete
1918 Fisher showed the two things were the same
Quantitative traits plant height
treat as discrete trait. tall vs. short
codominant -- additive -- so each A contributes 1 cm to height aa plants are 5cm tall, Aa 6, AA 7 -- so 3 possible heights and one way to get each (draw as # ways)
so what would dominant A look like?
aa 5cm Aa 7cm AA 7cm
now make two genes, both additive, each adds 1
A locus, B locus (make table of genotype, phenotype)
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
A locus, B locus (make table of genotype, phenotype)
a/a;b/b 5; a/A;b/b 6; A/A;b/b 7; a/a;B/b 6; a/a;B/B 7; a/A;b/B 7; A/A;b/B 8; a/A;B/B 8; A/A;B/B 9
can get intermediate in crosses, and transgressive segregation
Aabb (6) x AaBb (7) -> AABb (8) and aabb (5) and aaBb (6 but different genotype)
AABB (9) x aabb (5) -> all AaBb (7)
draw as # ways — how many different ways of getting a phenotype (one 5, two 6's, three 7's, two 8's, one 9) imagine you have 100 genes, each contributing different amount to plant height!
looks like a "bell curve" or normal distribution quantitative trait
statistically, you assume a quant. trait is controlled by an infinite number of genes (called quantitative trait loci or QTL that are additive and of small effect (can change all this and include epistasis, etc. etc. but much of the statistics is based on this) note that each individual gene is a normal Mendelian locus (point out A's and B's)
some real traits have been shown like this -- flowering time in maize
others not so much -- fruit size in tomato single gene 30% of effect, branching in maize also lg. % of effect single gene
Goal of association mapping and QTL mapping is to find the genes
that underly such a trait. Recombination
We've done a lot with independent assortment — what assumption? what does that mean physically?
things on different chromosomes, or far enough apart
what about things that are close together — called linked sometimes will go together, sometimes apart —read up on ch. 4 for details

sometimes will go together, sometimes apart —read up on ch. 4 for details
paper today uses identification of non-independent assortment to place genes on same chromosome arms

## How to read a scientific paper

Begin with the intro:

* what's the **BIG** question? Of the whole field?
	- One of the big questions we will see lots in genetics: how does genotype make phenotype?
* Summarize the background: what has been done, what needs to be done still?
* Identify specific questions. Is there a null hypothesis (not every paper)?

Now go to the methods

* Identify the approach
* Diagram or draw out what researchers did to answer individual parts of question.

Then results 

* Summarize each experiment, result, table (don't interpret, just summarize) 
* Focus on figures and tables -- lots of good results there.
* Supplementary info might be important too.
* Think about stats: sample size, error bars, significance?
* Do they answer the specific questions? Decide before moving on.

Discussion/Conclusions 

* What are authors interpretation of results?
* Do you agree? What did they miss?

Google away

* Google scholar or web search -- is it cited? What do others say?

General points

* read at least twice: once for main ideas, second time to understand important details
* not all details are important
* authors (and scientists) are not infallible
* it's OK not to understand every part of a paper
