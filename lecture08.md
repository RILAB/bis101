Ch. 7 skip 7.1 (Fig. 7.1 ranks as perhaps least useful figure in book)

## Notes

Exam will be online after class today at 8pm. Questions in office hours. Turned in only online. Etc.

## Changes in chromosome number:

Euploid -- multiples of a full set of chromosomes

- haploid <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
- diploid <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>
- monoploid (males in bees, wasps, ants.)  why bad <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> deleterious recessives
- with odd multiples problem is <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong>  draw triploid. explain **bivalents** and segregation of **univalents**

### Aneuploidy

Incomplete sets, too many or few of one or more chromosomes

- disomic, monosomic, trisomic etc.
- e.g. <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: red;">?</strong> Down's syndrome or trisomy 21. 

### Polyploid types

* autopolyploid - from single parent, doubles

* allopolyploid - from two different parents, usually F1 sterile, then doubles. **homeologous** chromosomes


### Gene balance

relative expression levels of genes matters.  relative expression of transcription factors that turns on cell growth in the middle or edge of a leaf you could imagine changes the shape of the leaf
                DRAW
            double copies of a gene, what effect on transcription? (double)
            double every gene in the genome, what's the effect on the relative ratio? (none)
            but aneuploidy increases the expression of a subset of genes, affecting gene balance
            plants more tolerant of this than animals (Fig. 17-18 of Datura fruits that are aneuploid for each of the chromosomes)
    Polyploidy
        polyploidy important historically in plants — almost all plants have gone through multiple rounds of polyploidy historically.   
        usually followed by fractionation (?) or gene loss like we read in the schnable paper.  
        end result is diploidization (?) or the process of making a polyploid look diploid again
        what's the evidence?
            Simple chromosome counting:
                for plants with chromosome numbers ≥12, even numbers are much more common than odd (why? chromosome doubling)
            Genomic data used to identify polyploidy
                draw and ask for interpretation 
                take all pairs of gene duplicates, measure sequence distance between them
                graph is # of pairs on y and seq. difference on x
                normally smooth exponential
                "bump" due to allopolyploidy event, a group of genes that all duplicated about the same time
                how interpret TWO bumps? (multiple events)
                now, since we know the mean sequence difference, if we also know the mutation rate per bp, we can estimate time!
                    Ks=μ*L
                        Ks is average distance per bp — if sees differ at 13 bp over 1kb, Ks=0.013
        Triploids and other odd numbered plods? why sterile?
            unlikely a gamete will get two of all chromosome or one of all chromosome in meiosis (draw) 
            so gametes are aneuploid, which causes problems (gene balance, exposed recessive deleterious)
        Autotetraploid
            increased chromosome copies come from same species
            can arise spontaneously, or be generated chemically (colchicine treatment arrests mitosis and the cell fails to split -> bam! polyploid cell)
            chromosomes usually pair up in quadrivalent (?) tetravalent 
        Allopolyploid
            increased chromosome copies come from a different species
            cabbage (2n=2x=18) x radish (2n=2x=18) -> sterile hybrid (2n=2x=18 or one copy of each haploid set of 9)
                why would be sterile? chromosomes too different to pair in meiosis, so does not produce viable gametes
                spontaneous doubling in hybrid led to fertility -> 2n=4x=36 (two copies of each haploid set of 9)
                book claims allopolyploidy more common than auto.  not sure the evidence supports that.  auto is harder to detect — behaves same, but bigger. 
                     can't detect it genomically as above (why?)
        Example: draw 17-9 from book
## Structural rearrangements
    deletion and insertion we've covered — but can happen to large regions
        why would a very large (100's of kb) deletion very likely be deleterious?
            remove gene copies, so likely very bad to lethal in homozygous form
        one kind of insertion is duplication of gene or region
            can be in tandem or dispersed (what book calls insertional duplication)
    double-stranded break — how repaired?
        if multiple breaks, and the wrong ends get stuck together, you get rearrangements
    also get rearrangements by faulty recombination — recombination between identical sequences that are not at the same locus 
        (what's an example? TEs)
    translocation
        draw before, after, meiosis (how pair?). show as both sister chromatids of each chromosomes
            ask: depending on pair that travel together can be inviable (adjacent) or viable (alternate)
    inversion
        can be paracentric (on one side of centromere) or pericentric (including centromere)
        draw sequence straight — leads to difficulties pairing in meiosis
        draw figure 17-28
        but in some plants (maize, 50% non homologous, 20% no pairing, 30% loop)
        either way, what is the effect? suppressed recombination
        explain example of mimulus — annual populations inland, perennial populations on the coast, annual vs. perennial due to genes in an inversion fixed in different populations
