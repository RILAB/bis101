## Allele effects

dominant
* bad mutations often but not always recessive — dominant negative

recessive

incomplete dominance (white/pink/red, draw genotypes) 
* intermediate phenotype — mixing on a quantitative scale
* remember this is from phenotype perspective -- here looks like mixing

codominance  — both alleles are expressed
* blood types (explain)
* at phenotypic level looks different from incomplete dominance
* at genetic level both are pretty much the same
* reality we treat dominance as a variable, where 0 is recessive and 1 is dominant, and phenotype can be e.g. 0, a*d, a (don't need to know, and notation not really correct)
        
lethal
* can be dominant or recessive — ??? why is recessive more common?

pleiotropy — has more than one effect
* often used in a lame way: ??? what other effects might allele that makes longer beans have
* "real" pleiotropy is traits that are less obviously correlated.  perhaps an enzyme is needed for pathway to flower and to make leaf hairs.  a mutant in the gene for that enzyme would have two phenotypes

Pathways
    genes not in vacuum and not just make one product that does it's thing
    we've considered effects of alleles at each gene independent of others
        effects of alleles at the round/wrinkled locus not change effects of alleles at the yellow/green locus
        not always the case
    ￼
        flowering time rice: ask what arrows/bars mean
    Let's consider simple pathway 
        precursor1-> (enzyme A from gene A)-> precursor2->(enzyme B gene B)->red fruit (wt ) DRAW (leave on board)
    make recessive lines of two recessive mutants (so now a<A and b<B), cross to make double mutants
        complementation if cross makes good
        if I cross two whites -> blue what genos? 
            aaBB x AAbb (both white) = ? AaBb (blue)
        why not use dominant mutants? (because no complementation even if in different genes)
            how do you know if your mutant is recessive? (make F1 and self!)
        what if I take two white plants w/ recessive mutants cross and = white?
            perhaps aaBB x a'a'BB = aa'BB (fail to complement b/c just two mutations of same gene)

        DO NOT memorize ratios 9:3:4 or 9:7 etc.
            know 9:3:3:1 and 3:1
Epistasis
    statistical epistasis is observation of an interaction, but unknown gene(s)
        effect depends on genotype or genetic background
            late flowering allele may make you flower 3 days later in one plant, but only 1 day later in another or 2 days earlier in a third
            that would be example of epistatic effects of the genetic background
            an allele that always made all plants flower 3 days later, regardless of genotype —> no epistatic interactions
    biochemical epistasis -> known pathway & functions
        back to drawing (precursors): precursor-> (enzyme A makes pigment)-> yellow pigment->(enzyme B turns yellow red)->red fruit (wt ) 
        aaBB ( white ); aabb (white); AAbb (yellow); AABB (red); AABB (red); 
            mutant a is epistatic to b —> mutation at locus A independent of locus B (always white)
            mutation at B depends on genotype at A (either yellow or white)
            the epistatic locus is upstream in the pathway, changing precursor or action of other genes downstream.  
        that's an example of recessive epistasis
        dominant is possible too!  so now Aa - -  would also be white!
Epistasis vocab (know definition, but not worry about crosses on test)
    suppressor  (mutant that suppresses effects of other mutant making it wt)
    synthetic lethals (two mutants @ different genes each nonlethal together lethal)
    penetrance (% individuals with the phenotype)
        e.g. mutant that makes you inefficient at getting water from soil will show low penetrance in an irrigated system
    expressivity how much expressed (little effect on drought tolerance or lots)
        can vary among individuals

section 6.3 on inferring gene interaction is good.


## Organellar - nuclear interaction
wild type plants produce two mito genes MG1 and MG2

multiple origins of novel ORF (what's an ORF?)
sterile pollen grains don't stain

sterility cosegregates w/ RFLP cutting extra ORF
